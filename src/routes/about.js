                    <p>Apsgrade is a web application that helps students calculate their Aps score.
                        Students need an Admission point score to qualify for admission at each institution in 
                        South Africa. Each institution has its own way of calculating its own Aps Score. Apsgrade unlike
                        Other aps calculators requires students to enter all their school subjects and calculates the Admission Point Score
                        for 22 Universities at once.
